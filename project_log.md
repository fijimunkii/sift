#Sift

A simple, but powerful todo-list / idea logger app.

Entering ideas should be intuitive. The ability to add options to the entry will be secondary.

The homepage of the app will show brief description of the app, with a registration form. There will be a link to login.

The user's homepage is a list of the ideas.

Keyboard shortcuts will filter results and trigger commands as you type.
* create / new / add
* share
*

The project is a simple CRUD app which will evolve into something a bit more dynamic.

Javascript AJAX calls will be used to streamline the interface.
